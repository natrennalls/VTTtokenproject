# VTTtokenproject
Working on a module for VTT foundry for a hex-crawl styled game. The idea is that the adventures that the party encounters will rely on time, so in order to track them and make sure that the DM doesn't lose their mind, I'll be working on a module that keeps current time of day, the list of quests, and will update the status of how much time is left to finish the quest.
